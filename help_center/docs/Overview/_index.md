## What is it?

SportFin is a digital platform that helps community sport organisations leverage data about the people they engage and the impacts they generate to help them fundraise better. This internal documentation site is to help developers working for SportFin get started with local development and help them find their way around the SportFin codebase.

## Why do I want it?

This site would help you, as a developer at SportFin, get started as soon as possible and allow you to start contributing as soon as possible: 

* **What is it good for?**: When a new developer joins an organisation, there might be significant toil involved in getting them started and help them start contributing to the project. Good internal documentation help relieve a lot of this toil.

* **What is it not good for?**: This is not documentation for external use. This documentation is mainly for developers working at SportFin.

* **What is it *not yet* good for?**: This site is new and is evolving - as such it does not cover all bases of the codebase yet. If you notice any issues that, please create a documentation issue.

## Where should I go next?

Give your users next steps from the Overview. For example:

* [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/): Get started with $project
* [Examples](/docs/examples/): Check out some example code!
