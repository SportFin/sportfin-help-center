The SportFin web application has been built in the Django framework using Python, and we have used a static front-end (HTML, CSS, Javascript) for our UI. 

Let's get you familiarised with the core concepts of our tech stack:
* **Django docs**: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/
* **Python docs**: https://docs.python.org/3/
* **Javascript docs**: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
