        "body": "<div class=\"intercom-container\"><img src=\"https://sportfin.intercom-attachments-1.com/i/o/686463957/4946b28536e0391c8ae31bbd/Achievement-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Achievement - Dorset Spotlight\"></div><p class=\"no-margin\">Fundraising is an essential aspect for most community sport organisations, particularly in the currently economic climate - our research has show that 2/5 community sport organisations rely on external funding to make ends meet. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">However, applying for funding is not a straightforward process, and funders generally want sport organisations to be able to report back on various data points relating to their sport activities. Funders tend to require specific data segments to assess the impact of their funding and ensure it benefits their intended target audience. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">In this article, we will explore some of the key data points sport funders look for from their beneficiaries.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_3e4501e418\">Who are you engaging?</h3>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">When it comes to sport funding, it's important to consider who you are engaging in your activities. Sport funders, whether they are government organisations or private sponsors, are often interested in gathering information about the participants in the sports programs they are funding. Specifically, they want to know the demographics of the individuals taking part in these activities, including details such as their age, gender, and location.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">By collecting this information, sport funders can evaluate if the sports programs they are investing in are reaching their intended target audience. For example, if a funder is focusing on increasing female participation in sports, they would expect to see a higher proportion of female participants in the activities that were delivered. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">This helps them to ensure that their funding is being used effectively to support the development of sport within specific communities or target groups. Therefore, it's important for sports organisations and clubs to gather and report this information accurately to demonstrate the impact of their activities and secure future funding opportunities.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_641042ecd1\">What type of sessions are you delivering?</h3>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Sport funders are interested in gathering information about the specifics of the activities, including the type of sports being offered (such as football, rugby, cricket, etc.) and the types of participation, whether it's individual or team-based.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">In addition, funders may also be interested in the intensity of the engagement, which refers to how often participants are engaging in sport activities and for how long. This can provide valuable insights into the level of commitment and interest from participants, as well as how well the programs are meeting the needs of the target audience.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Furthermore, funders may also inquire about where the activities are being delivered. This includes the location of the activities, whether it's in a gym, park, or community center. This information helps funders to determine if the activities align with their funding objectives and if they are being delivered in suitable locations for the target audience.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_0c64c86729\">How often are people engaging?</h3>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">In addition to knowing the retention rates of participants, funders may also be interested in the frequency and duration of the sport activities. For example, they may want to know if the participants are engaging in sport activities on a weekly basis, biweekly, or monthly. They may also want to know the duration of each session and whether the frequency and duration are appropriate for the target audience.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Furthermore, funders may be interested in understanding the reasons behind participant dropouts, such as lack of interest, scheduling conflicts, or other barriers. This information can help funders to identify any issues and address them to improve the retention rates and overall impact of the funded sport activities.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_2b705356d5\">What are the reasons people are missing or not coming back for sessions?</h3>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">In addition to knowing the retention rates, funders may also want to know the reasons why people may not be returning for sessions. This information helps funders to identify any issues that may be hindering the effectiveness of their funding. For instance, if participants are missing sessions due to transportation issues, funders may consider providing transport services to improve attendance rates.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">In conclusion, sport funders are interested in specific data segments when applying for funding. These include the demographics of the participants, the type of activities being delivered, the intensity of engagement, the location of the activities, participant retention rates, and reasons why people may not be returning for sessions. Providing this information helps funders to assess the impact of their funding and ensure that it is benefiting the intended target audience.</p>\n<hr><h3 id=\"h_44cbdd3165\">How can SportFin help manage the requirements of funders for your sport organisation?</h3>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">SportFin, a social impact analytics platform, offers a solution to automate the collection and analysis of data required by sport funders and sponsors.

        "description": "A quick guide to utilising the impact stories function to generate funding for your club.",
        "body": "<p class=\"no-margin\">Impact stories can be a powerful tool for community sport clubs to leverage funding and donations by demonstrating the positive impact they have on the community they serve. Impact stories are personal anecdotes or case studies that illustrate how the club has made a difference in the lives of its members, volunteers, or beneficiaries. Here are some ways that impact stories can help community sport clubs leverage funding and donations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Demonstrate the club's impact: Impact stories can help demonstrate the positive impact the club has on the community it serves. By sharing stories of how the club has helped members achieve their goals, overcome challenges, or make positive changes in their lives, the club can illustrate its value and impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Build emotional connections: Impact stories can help build emotional connections with donors and supporters by showcasing the club's human impact. When donors can see the tangible difference the club is making in people's lives, they are more likely to feel a personal connection to the cause and be motivated to donate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Inspire action: Impact stories can inspire action by showcasing the need for funding and support. By sharing stories of members who have faced obstacles or challenges, the club can demonstrate the need for additional funding to help more members achieve their goals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Differentiate the club: Impact stories can help differentiate the club from other organisations by highlighting its unique impact and value. By showcasing the personal stories of members and volunteers, the club can distinguish itself as an organisation that is making a real difference in the community.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Generate media coverage: Impact stories can generate media coverage and publicity for the club. When local media outlets see the positive impact the club is making in the community, they may be more likely to feature the club in their news coverage, which can help raise awareness and generate support.</p>\n</li>\n</ol><p class=\"no-margin\">In summary, impact stories can help community sport clubs leverage funding and donations by demonstrating the club's impact, building emotional connections, inspiring action, differentiating the club, and generating media coverage. By sharing personal stories of how the club has made a difference in the lives of its members and the community, the club can demonstrate its value and generate support for its mission.</p>",

We’ll cover 3 of our top tips for making a competitive funding application or crowdfunding campaign.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<div class=\"intercom-interblocks-callout\" style=\"background-color: #e8e8e880; border-color: #73737633;\">\n<div class=\"intercom-container\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sportfin.io\"><img src=\"https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/687697873/8cba95d5f7c391c0424742d6/Use+Impact+Data+to+Fundraise+3x+Better..png\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"intercom-container\"><a class=\"intercom-h2b-button\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sportfin.io\">Find out more</a></div>\n</div><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<hr><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_caa6062b36\">Here are some key tips to consider when fundraising for your sport organisation:</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">When creating a funding application or fundraising campaign, it is important to clearly articulate your project's goals and objectives, demonstrate its potential impact, and provide a well-researched budget that accurately reflects the costs associated with achieving those goals. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_553374b138\">1. Set clear goals, objectives and budgets: </h4>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">When you are planning to fundraise, the first step is to decide how much money you need and what you need it for. This will help you set clear and achievable goals that you can work towards. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Let's say your sports club needs £5,000 to purchase new equipment for your football team. You might set a goal to raise that amount within three months. This means you need to raise an average of £1,667 per month to reach your goal.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">To achieve this, you might consider a combination of fundraising methods. For example, you could create a crowdfunding campaign on a platform like <a href=\"https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/funds/sports\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">Crowdfunder</a>, where you set a goal of £2,500 and offer rewards like merchandise or experiences in exchange for donations. You could also apply for a grant from <a href=\"https://www.sportengland.org/funds-and-campaigns/our-funds\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">Sport England</a>, which offers funding for equipment purchases.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Identify potential donors or funders and tailor you funding message to their needs. For example, if your crowdfunding from parents and relatives of your participants, focus your message to the benefits it would generate for their kids. Or if you aim to apply for a grant, highlight how your organisation is furthering their mission and objectives.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_ced15c7314\"><b>2. Choose the right fundraising method: </b></h4>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">There are many ways to raise money for your sport organisation, including using crowdfunding and applying for grants. However, choosing the right method for your organisation is crucial for success. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b><i>Using crowdfunding:</i></b><i> </i></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You can use crowdfunding platforms like <a href=\"https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">Crowdfunder</a>, <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">JustGiving </a>or <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/en-gb\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">GoFundme </a>to raise money for your sport organisation. When using crowdfunding platforms, it's important to keep in mind that these platforms are most effective for raising smaller amounts of funding. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Additionally, it's best to have a fairly sizable community to engage with in order to increase your chances of success. One effective way to engage your community is to reach out to your participants and their friends and family, as they are likely to be most interested in supporting your cause. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">By leveraging the power of your existing network and using crowdfunding platforms strategically, you can successfully raise funds for your sport organisation and build a sense of community around your cause.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b><i>Applying for grants:</i></b> </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">There are many grants available to sports organisations in the UK. The most common sources of grants are the National Lottery Community Fund, Sport England, and local authorities. Look for grants that fit your club's mission and goals. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Make sure to look up the main objectives of the particular fund you are applying to and try to evidence how your sport organisation might further their objectives. There are <a href=\"https://evaluationframework.sportengland.org/design-phase/identify-measurement-and-evaluation-priorities/?visitor=partner\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\">helpful resources</a> for this on Sport England's website.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You can also use SportFin's social impact reporting automations to support funding applications with real-time impact reports, or create your own impact reports using rich-text editors and embeddable data visualisations.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<div class=\"intercom-container\"><img src=\"https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/687559607/35d20d9cb7d43911ebea5584/Custom+reports.gif\"></div><h4 id=\"h_eba7570bf8\">3. Create a compelling impact story</h4>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">To be successful, you need to have a clear understanding of your goals and needs, and promote your fundraising efforts effectively. Creating a compelling social impact story can help you connect with potential supporters and demonstrate the positive impact your sports club has on the community. Your organisation's impact story will be the key driver of your fundraising efforts, whether you are crowdfunding or applying for grants.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Your social impact story should showcase how your sports club has made a difference in the lives of its members and the wider community. This could include sharing stories of individuals who have benefited from your club's activities, such as improved health or social connections. You might also highlight how your club supports local initiatives or contributes to important causes.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<div class=\"intercom-container\"><img src=\"https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/617872444/86e8b2d21c95da9812bba376/Impact+Stories.gif\"></div><p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<hr><h2 id=\"h_f5b8808a05\">What can you do with SportFin</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">SportFin is a free tool that helps community sport organisations fundraise better by automating social impact reporting.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">With SportFin, you have the ability to collect the necessary data you will need to create a compelling impact story by simply digitising you day-to-day activities on our <b>free CRM</b>, or by importing data via our importer tool.  </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<div class=\"intercom-container\"><img src=\"https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/687567454/18dca1da8cfcb942c0204654/Custom+analytics.gif\"></div><p class=\"no-margin\">SportFin can help you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Generate various data visualisations to tell powerful stories through data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Automate impact reporting and allow you to create and share reports with real-time embedded data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Crowdfund through our 'Impact Stories' feature, that embeds impact data into crowdfunding pages. </p>\n</li>\n</ol><p class=\"no-margin\">Click here find out more about our<a href=\"https://help.sportfin.io/en/articles/6560785-social-impact-analytics-for-sport-organisations\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"intercom-content-link\"> impact analytics and crowdfunding tools</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>",
